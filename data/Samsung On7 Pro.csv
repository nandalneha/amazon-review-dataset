This is an averange low end device. In this price range there are a lot of phones better than this.‚Ä¢Build Quality- The build quality is average, nothing appreciatable.‚Ä¢Camera Quality- Camera gives accurate color reproduction. That's good. But detailing is not up to the mark.‚Ä¢Sound Quality- The sound quality is pretty better.‚Ä¢Processor- The processor is not much powerful. Not for any kind of gaming. Heating issue comes on constant use of phone.‚Ä¢Battery- The battery life is quite bad. It have a juice of one day only if you make calls or surf a little otherwise you have to charge twice the mobile.‚Ä¢Price- In this price range I won't recommend it to buy.
